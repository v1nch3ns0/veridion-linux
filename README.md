# veridion linux
veridion linux is a lightweight and super simple systemd linux distro made by me for fun.
it uses zeropkg as the package manager, a shell script (POSIX) package manager that is ultra minimal and
under less than 200 lines of code.
## features
now it is still in heavy development but it is still (semi) usable
it uses busybox (musl) for basic utils and bash as a shell, has getty for login stuff
ethernet is kind of implemented and is built straight into the kernel (e1000 and untested virtio)
at the stage rn, it is a basic but usable linux enviroment
## goals
- not use systemd, i dont like how it tries to do everything haha
- make an installer, this is a wip and definetly not finished yet
- make it daily drivable and maybe popular, always a good way to think ig
## why i made it
it was a really REALLY good way to learn the super deep linux internals and its super fun to do,
i mean when your not dealing with deps but thats beside the point i made it for fun
## downloads
check releases (BIOS only no UEFI support yet ): )
